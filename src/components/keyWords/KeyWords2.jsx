              caution flag, is displayed by race officials to indicate a hazard
              or dangerous situation on the track. When shown, drivers must slow

              severe weather, accidents, or track obstructions. When shown,
              drivers must immediately stop on the track in a safe manner.

              <strong>Checkered Flag:</strong> The checkered flag is waved by
              race officials to signal the end of a race or session. It is waved
              as the lead car crosses the finish line, indicating that all other
              cars should complete the current lap and proceed to the pit lane.
            </li>

              <strong>Blue Flag:</strong> A blue flag is shown to a driver to
              indicate that they are about to be lapped by a faster car. The
              driver receiving the blue flag must yield to the faster car at the
              earliest opportunity, allowing it to pass safely without impeding
              its progress.
